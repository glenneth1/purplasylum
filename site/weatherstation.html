It's a piece that would feel equally at home in orchestral FM rotation or a Village Vanguard setlist. But where previous Weather Station albums focused primarily on meticulous construction, &quot;Humanhood&quot; finds equal fascination in deconstruction, exploring the spaces between completion and dissolution.</p><p>This avant-garde sensibility manifests beautifully in &quot;Window,&quot; where Lindeman's vocals navigate an understated discord of percussion, synths, and fuzzy guitars. &quot;Ribbon&quot; further pushes this exploration, playing with staccato and glissando contrasts, while tight, rim-focused drumwork and a dynamically shifting piano create an ever-evolving soundscape.</p><p>&quot;Mirror&quot; emerges as a standout track, marrying summer-tinged melodies with rock-influenced beats and synth textures that evoke late-night epiphanies. Lindeman's vocal performance here strikes a remarkable balance, channeling Jenny Hval's art-pop experimentation while maintaining the accessible appeal of Sarah McLachlan or Joni Mitchell.</p><p>The title track delves deep into human conditioning and exhaustion (&quot;I been... carrying a body that's tired from carrying a mind&quot;), while &quot;Body Moves&quot; continues this mind-body dialogue with a more playful instrumental interplay between piano and fiddle. &quot;Lonely&quot; stands as the album's most introspective moment, with Lindeman turning her habitual mistrust inward, backed by ephemeral instrumentation that recalls recent work by Cassandra Jenkins.</p><p>Throughout &quot;Humanhood,&quot; certain words surface repeatedly like buoys in Lindeman's ocean of sound: body, water, trust, knot, and most frequently, pain. This pain manifests in various forms - sometimes shattering and physical, other times fundamentally ordinary: &quot;My pain is ordinary, I'm just like anybody.&quot; The album culminates in the contemplative &quot;Sewing,&quot; where Lindeman weaves together life's contrasting patterns of &quot;pride and shame, beauty and guilt,&quot; finally finding peace in life's dualities: &quot;I'm taking pictures of the sky again, I don't know whyâ€”I guess I wanted to.&quot;</p><p>While the improvisational tone and occasional discordance might challenge some listeners, Lindeman's masterful reconciliation of minimalist and maximalist tendencies creates a compelling narrative about human experience. &quot;Humanhood&quot; stands as a testament to finding ground in uncertainty, making peace with pain, and rediscovering joy in life's simple acts. It's a bold step forward for The Weather Station, one that honors past works while fearlessly charting new territory.</p></main></body></html>
