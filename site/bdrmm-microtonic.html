From their bedroom-project beginnings to their current status as Rock Action's rising stars, they've consistently pushed their sonic boundaries. With 'Microtonic', they've made their boldest leap yet - loosening the dense, anxious tension of their previous works into something more spacious and hypnotic.</p><p>Opening track 'goit - goit' sets the tone immediately, featuring Working Men's Club's Syd Minsky-Sargeant's haunting vocals over a landscape of post-rock drones and electronic pulses. The track's sinister undertones and club-ready darkness signal bdrmm's newfound confidence in electronic territories. This confidence flows seamlessly into 'John on the Ceiling', where dreamy synths and repetitive beats create an alternate dimension that's impossible to resist moving to.</p><p>'Infinity Peaking' serves as a perfect bridge between old and new bdrmm. As guitarist Ryan Smith notes, it &quot;perfectly encapsulates the band we were and the band we are now.&quot; The track balances their shoegaze roots with their electronic evolution, creating something that feels both nostalgic and forward-looking. The experimentation in its mid-section showcases a band clearly enjoying their studio exploration.</p><p>The album's centerpiece, 'In The Electric Field', featuring Olivesque's (Olivia Rees) mesmerizing vocals, is a masterclass in build and release. The track's therapeutic, spoken-word delivery evolves into a crescendo of distorted guitars and synth melodies that feel both overwhelming and perfectly controlled. It's here where bdrmm's new direction truly crystallizes - they're not abandoning their guitar-based roots, but rather expanding their palette with electronic textures that add depth and dimension.</p><p>'Lake Disappointment' stands as perhaps the album's finest moment. Its meditative pulse and hypnotic repetition create a weightless quality that draws listeners into a dreamlike state. The warped bass line and hurling rhythm drive the song to its taut conclusion, demonstrating bdrmm's newfound ability to let their music breathe while maintaining its emotional impact.</p><p>The album closes with 'The Noose', a cinematic piece that feels both final and transformative. It's a fitting end to an album that shows bdrmm stepping confidently into new territory while keeping their emotional core intact. The shadowy wall of sound remains - that's the bdrmm promise - but it's less dense, less claustrophobic, and all the more powerful for it.</p><p>'Microtonic' is more than just an evolution - it's a revelation. It shows a band willing to push beyond their comfort zone while maintaining their essential character. The result is an album that feels both familiar and fresh, rooted in the past but firmly looking forward. In the words of frontman Ryan Smith, &quot;This is what bdrmm sound like&quot; - and what they sound like is a band at the height of their powers, ready to take on whatever comes next.</p></main></body></html>
