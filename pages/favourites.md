# Personal favourites

My personal list of favourite artists and albums from over the too many years.  In no particular order.

- [Radiohead - Hail to the Thief](hail.html) - A masterful blend of Radiohead's raw emotion and experimental edge, creating an album that feels both hauntingly prescient and deeply personal.
- [Depeche Mode](depeche.html) - Depeche Mode's moody synth-pop and dark, introspective lyrics have redefined electronic music and influenced countless artists, making them a timeless favorite.
- [Sharon Van Etten](vanetten-faves.html) - A Voice of Strength in Vulnerability.
- [Damien Rice - O](rice-faves.html) - Haunting, emotional, love and heartbreak
