# Soccer Mommy

## Abigail - Friday, October 25, 2024 (Loma Vista)

Sophia Regina Allison AKA Soccer Mommy brings us our indie-rock medicine through the form of her new charming single, “Abigail”. Sitting sixth on her new album, “Evergreen”, this fresh and inviting release ticks all my boxes with a vibe which is akin to many indie stalwarts from yesteryear!

Immediately, I hear The Cure vibes leaking out of the mix with a synthy direction which is also comparable to many synth bands from the 80s. The track greets us with a warm tone in the opening following an introductory drum fill. Soccer Mommy soon emerges with a dreamy and echoey vocal delivery. The second she reaches for the microphone is the second that I am hooked! The music is perfectly delivered and matches the narrative expressed by Soccer Mommy. Also, the track sounds incredible played on a 5:1 stereo sound setup.


The track delves deep into themes such as infatuation and desire. Moreover, Soccer Mommy longs to be alone with “Abigail”. There is also an element of mystery present within the narrative as the singer talks about her purple hair and unique interests. But, despite the positive dreamy aspects, there is also the sad realisation that the feelings maybe one-sided with Soccer Mommy almost painting a picture of “Abigail” as being mythical, there is an idolisation of them. Also, there could be a yearning for a deep bond with “Abigail”, something which has yet to come to fruition.

Overall, I am in love with “Abigail” by Soccer Mommy. I have been a fan of the singer-songwriter since 2018 when I first came across, “Henry” and this new track pulls me into the singers universe even more!
