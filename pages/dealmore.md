# Kim Deal

## Nobody loves You more - Released 22-NOV-2024 on 4AD

Kim Deal's musical journey is one that few artists could ever hope to replicate. Co-founder of the iconic Pixies and mastermind behind The Breeders, her career spans decades of distinct and groundbreaking contributions to alternative rock. With "Nobody Loves You More," her first-ever solo album, Deal delivers not an attempted reintroduction, but a testament to her timeless craft—an organic collection of fragments accumulated over the past 14 years, woven together with the help of friends and collaborators like the late, great Steve Albini, her Breeders bandmates, and former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist Josh Klinghoffer.

The album kicks off with the cinematic title track, carried by lush strings and an expansive brass interlude, a splash of Bond theme influence announcing Deal's intent to push her sound into new territories. The delicate "Are You Mine" immortalizes her mother’s loving confusion in the form of an airy love song, while the triumphant "Disobedience" sees Deal take center stage with fiery confidence. Her scattered wails on "Big Ben Beat" recall the raw energy of early 2000s Brandon Flowers, paired with a blistering bassline reminiscent of The Breeders' 1993 classic "Last Splash." Despite some slight repetitiveness, songs like "Crystal Breath" embody her unorthodox approach, combining driving rhythms with sharp lyrics and standout metaphors.

Steve Albini, who worked closely with Deal over three decades, once praised her tenacity in pursuing specific sounds, even if it meant years of work or enormous costs. This unyielding approach is evident throughout "Nobody Loves You More." Every song exudes Deal’s distinctive personality—tenderness intertwined with tartness, atmospheric soundscapes, and a mix of thumps, whooshes, and bug-zapper guitars. It's all carried by her unmistakable voice, which is still a fusion of charm, attitude, and grit. Tracks like "Disobedience" and "Come Running" evoke the spirit of The Breeders, while songs like "Wish I Was" shine with effervescent pop sensibilities and slightly off-kilter expressions of feeling.

"Nobody Loves You More" is both a fresh evolution of Deal's sound and an album that celebrates her enduring brilliance. The cast of collaborators may be large, but the core of the record is unmistakably Kim Deal—her willingness to explore new ideas, embrace the moment, and create timeless music. Whether it's through the string and horn sections that bring new textures to the title track, or the prickly post-punk guitars of "Crystal Breath," the album captures Deal in her native mode: forever curious, forever creative.

Deal's journey has been marked by loss and resilience—losing both her parents in 2019 and 2020, and then the sudden passing of Steve Albini earlier this year. These experiences thread through the album, reminding us that even though Kim Deal may not be immortal, her music makes it feel as though she is. "Nobody Loves You More" is not only a reflection of the past but a celebration of where she is now—a testament to her distinctive voice, relentless pursuit of sound, and ability to transform the ordinary into something extraordinary.
